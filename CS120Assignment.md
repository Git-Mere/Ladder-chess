# CS120 Game Prototype 1

## Introduction

This assignment will be in sync with your GAM100 prototype 1 assignment. In this assignment you will use C++ and the `doodle` framework to create a game prototype.

GAM100 will grade based off of the game design and game production. CS120 will grade based off of your use of C++.

## Submission

Your project will be hosted on GitHub via GitHub classroom assignment. This will also be your submission location.

# Create a ReadMe


Create a **`CS120ReadMe.md`** markdown file that defines the following.

1. Your names, assignment name/number, course name, term
2. Section describing anything incomplete about the assignment
3. Section describing something you're proud of about the assignment
4. Section that lists the File Name and Line Number for all code requirements
    - one example is enough if there are multiple instances
